Go to http://resolve.github.com/refinerycms

Take a look at how to add tutorials, and thank you in advance for adding some :)

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Is there a better alternative to beginner/intermediate/advanced for categories?
- DRY up the index.html categories with some kind of loop
- Using javascript, add DISQUS to the tutorial pages for comments
- Clean up a lot of the extra code and css styles
