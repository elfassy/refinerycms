Write your tutorial using markdown

You can surround your code with the following to highlight it

    { % highlight ruby % } 
    Make sure you remove the space between { and %
    { % endhighlight % }

Or you can just indent code with 4 spaces

Take a look at other examples in the "\_posts" folder
