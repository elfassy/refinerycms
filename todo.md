# Todo

What are some of the known things that need to be done?

## Internationalization

We've got a branch for it and we need to merge that into the master.

## Tests

* Add unit test coverage for user, user plugin and user mailer
* Add unit test coverage for inquiry mailer and inquiry setting
* Add functional tests for the whole of Refinery.

# Rails 3.0 Support

We've started an effort to move to Rails 3.0 - that just needs to be completed.
